Some documents about SECS (SEMI Equipment Communication Standards) 

# simulator software
Actually, SECS is more complex than modbus, there exists some simulator in free.
You can find it from https://www.semisecs.com/reference/
I also have some one, but for license reason, I can't share it, please contact me if you need.
